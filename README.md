[Kestrel] ðŸ¦…
A lightweight Python chess engine exploring the art of search and strategy, trained on master-level games for tactical precision.

About The Project
[Kestrel] is a passion project born from an interest in building lightweight, custom search engines. I wanted to apply those principles to one of the most fascinating search problems: the game of chess. This engine is built entirely in Python, leveraging modern AI techniques to create a strong and tactical opponent.

The primary goal is to create an engine that excels in the midgame. Its evaluation function has been fine-tuned using data from thousands of recently played master-level games to recognize subtle positional advantages and tactical patterns.
