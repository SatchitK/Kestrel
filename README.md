## ðŸ“– About The Project

Kestrel is a passion project born from an interest in building lightweight, custom search engines. I wanted to apply those principles to one of the most fascinating search problems: the game of chess.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of Kestrel running on your local machine.

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory**

    Move into the newly created folder:
    ```
    cd Kestrel
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**

    Install all the required Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file.
